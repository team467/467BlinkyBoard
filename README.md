# 467BlinkyBoard
Team 467 blinky project to design/build a practice soldering kit

Taking inspiration from the "wee blinky" kit found here https://www.dalewheat.com/product/wee-blinky/, this project will adapt this basic LED blinking circuit to become more customized for FRC team 467.

Goals:
- Develop soldering practice kit
- Customize LEDs to blue and gold (yellow)
- Alter PCB size and shape
