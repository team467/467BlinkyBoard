# 467BlinkyBoard
Team 467 blinky project to design/build a practice soldering kit

## Overview
Taking inspiration from the "wee blinky" kit found here https://www.dalewheat.com/product/wee-blinky/, this project will adapt this basic LED blinking circuit to become more customized for FRC team 467.  Overall goal is to involve students in the process of developing a circuit board product from scratch and ultimately producing it to be used as part of our fall training sessions.

## Project Goals
- Develop soldering practice kit
- Engage students in the design and product development process
- Customize LEDs to blue and gold (yellow)
- Alter PCB size and shape
